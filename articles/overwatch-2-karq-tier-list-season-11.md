# Recreating KarQ's Tier Lists (OW2, S11)

## Introduction: Season 11 Meta Overview

Overwatch 2's Season 11, dubbed "Super Mega Ultrawatch," brought significant changes to the competitive landscape.
Launched on June 20, 2024, this season introduced a mix of hero buffs and reworks that shook up the meta across all
roles.

The competitive scene saw a shift towards more aggressive playstyles, with several heroes receiving buffs that enhanced
their offensive capabilities. Cassidy's rework, replacing his Magnetic Grenade with an improved Flashbang, added a new
dimension to crowd control strategies.

Tank players found themselves with more options as several off-tanks received buffs, leading to more diverse team
compositions. Support heroes also saw adjustments, with some becoming more self-sufficient and others gaining enhanced
utility.

The impact of these changes was significant, with Game Director Aaron Keller revealing some official win rates. For
instance, Pharah boasted a 58% win rate across all ranks at the beginning of Season 11, highlighting the strength of
certain heroes in the new meta.

These changes prompted players and content creators alike to reassess hero viability, leading to updated tier lists and
strategy discussions within the community. KarQ, a prominent Overwatch content creator known for his insightful
analysis, was quick to provide his rankings for the new season.

In this article, we'll use OpenTierBoy to recreate KarQ's Overwatch Season 11 rankings, demonstrating how this tool can
effectively visualize and compare tier lists as the meta evolves.

## Understanding KarQ's Tier System

Before we dive into recreating KarQ's Season 11 rankings, let's review his tier system. KarQ categorizes heroes into
different tiers based on their effectiveness in the current meta:

- **S [Meta]:** These heroes are considered the strongest and most impactful in the current meta. They often define team
  compositions and strategies.
- **A [Great]:** Heroes in this tier are very strong and reliable picks in most situations.
- **B+ [Good]:** These heroes are solid choices that can perform well in many scenarios.
- **B [Fine]:** Heroes in this tier are balanced and can be effective when played skillfully.
- **C [Niche / Depends on comp]:** These heroes may excel in specific situations or team compositions but are less
  versatile overall.
- **D [Tough]:** Underperforming heroes in the current meta.

For the Mid-Season update, KarQ introduced a new tier:

- **B- [Okayish]:** Heroes that are... okay..ish.

## Key Factors Influencing Hero Placements

KarQ's hero rankings are influenced by several factors beyond just hero abilities:

- Armor Changes: The mid-season patch included significant changes to how armor works, affecting many heroes. For
  instance, D.Va benefited greatly from these changes, while heroes like Soldier: 76 and Sojourn were negatively
  impacted.
- Rise of 'Flyers': Heroes like Pharah and Echo saw increased play, influencing the viability of other heroes who
  struggle to counter them.
- Tank Dominance: The patch emphasized the strength of tanks, with KarQ referring to them as 'Kaiju Titans.' This shift
  affected which DPS and support heroes were most effective.
- Specific Ability Changes: KarQ discusses how even small changes to abilities can have significant impacts. For
  example, the adjustment to Cassidy's falloff range changed his optimal playstyle.

## OpenTierBoy: Streamlining Content Creation
