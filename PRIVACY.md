# OpenTierBoy Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: 18 July 2024**

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information
when you use the Service and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.

## Hosting Provider

Our Service is hosted by Vercel. For details on how Vercel collects and uses data, please refer
to [Vercel's Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy).

## Collection of Information

### Information You Provide to Us

We do not collect any personal data from users directly through the Service.

### Information Collected Automatically

We do not collect any information directly. Any automatic collection of anonymized data, such as page views and usage
metrics, is performed by Vercel in accordance with their privacy practices. This data does not include personal
identifiers and is used for improving the Service.

### Local Storage

Our Service uses local storage for functionality purposes. Local storage is used to enhance user experience by saving
preferences and ensuring the proper functioning of the Service. This information is stored on your device and is not
shared with us or any third parties.

## Use of Information

Any anonymized information collected by Vercel is used for various purposes, including:

- Providing, maintaining, and improving our services;
- Monitoring and analyzing trends, usage, and activities in connection with our services.

By accessing and using our services, you consent to the processing and transfer of your information by Vercel in
accordance with their privacy practices.

## Sharing of Information

We do not share any personal information directly. However, Vercel may share anonymized data as part of their standard
operations. For detailed information on how Vercel handles data, please refer
to [Vercel's Privacy Policy](https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy).

## Handling of User-Uploaded Images

OpenTierBoy allows users to upload images for use in their tier lists. We handle these images as follows:

1. **Storage**: Images uploaded by users are not stored on our servers. They are processed client-side and may be
   temporarily cached in the user's browser or local storage for functionality purposes.
2. **Sharing**: When a user shares a tier list, only the references to the images (e.g., URLs or local identifiers) are
   included in the shareable link. The actual image files are not transmitted through our servers.
3. **Responsibility**: Users are responsible for the content of the images they upload and use. We do not monitor or
   moderate
   user-uploaded images.
4. **Removal**: Since we do not store user-uploaded images on our servers, we cannot directly remove them. However,
   users can clear their local storage to remove any cached images from their devices.

## Security

We take reasonable measures to help protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy
are effective when they are posted on this page.
